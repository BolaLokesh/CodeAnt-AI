# Frontend Assignment for CodeAnt AI

This is a frontend project for the CodeAnt AI internship assignment. It implements a user interface based on a design provided in Figma. The project uses **ReactJS**, **HTML**, and **CSS** to create a responsive and functional website. The goal was to create a clean, maintainable frontend implementation based on the design, ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes.

## Features

- **ReactJS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Responsive Design**: The design is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Reusable Components**: Components like `Button`, `Card`, and `Header` are modular and reusable throughout the project.
- **Interactivity**: Buttons and forms have basic interactivity (e.g., button clicks and form submissions).
